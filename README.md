# Nude Project Clone

This project is a clone of the **Nude Project** website, developed for both frontend and backend. It is my first personal full stack project, created with Angular and .NET, applying all the knowledge I have acquired during my training and work experience.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a complete web application that showcases my technical skills in full stack development. This project will serve as a key piece in my professional portfolio, aimed at being showcased to recruiters and potential employers.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Angular (latest version)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Components and Tools:**
  - Angular Material (for UI components)
  - RxJS (for reactive programming)
  - SCSS (for custom styles)

### Backend
- **Framework:** .NET 8
- **Language:** C#
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **REST API:** ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Identity Server / JWT (depending on project scope)
- **Testing:** xUnit for unit and integration tests

## Project Structure

- **/frontend:** Contains all the source code for the Angular application.
- **/backend:** Contains the source code for the .NET API.
- **/docs:** Additional documentation on project architecture, technical decisions, and setup guides.

## Planned Features

- **User Authentication:** Registration and login, JWT-based authentication.
- **Product Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products.
- **Shopping Cart System:** Allows users to add products to the cart and proceed with the purchase.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to process transactions.
- **Admin Panel:** Interface for managing users, products, and orders.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- .NET 8 SDK installed
- SQL Server or Docker to run the database

### Steps to Start the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nude-project-clone.git
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Configure the database:**
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`.
   - Apply migrations:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

5. **Start the application:**
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Creation of the REST API with .NET 8.
- [ ] Basic implementation of the frontend with Angular.
- [ ] Integration of the frontend with the backend.
- [ ] Unit and integration testing.
- [ ] Deployment on a server or cloud service (e.g., Azure, AWS).
- [ ] Optimization and performance improvements.

## Next Steps

- **Testing:** Implementation of automated tests to ensure code quality.
- **Documentation:** Add more technical documentation on architecture and technical decisions.
- **Deployment:** Plan to deploy the application in a production environment.

### Suggestions to Make the README More Attractive:
1. **Screenshots:** Consider adding images or gifs showing the project in action.
2. **Live Deployment:** Provide a link to a deployed version on a cloud server, so recruiters can directly test the application.
3. **Use Cases:** Add a section describing possible use cases or scenarios where your application could be used.
4. **Technical Challenges:** List the main technical challenges you faced and how you solved them. This demonstrates your problem-solving abilities.
5. **Demo Video:** A short video showing the workflow and main features can be very appealing.
